I will assume you've got the following down, on the basis that you're not a dumb fuck. 

- Owning a guitar
- Holding a guitar
- Pressing a fret
- Playing a note
- Strumming downwards AND upwards

If you're able to play a chord or two, that puts you at a huge advantage already. 

By the way, as long as your instrument has strings and makes noise somewhat in tune, it's a good guitar. I've seen people absolutely shred on those ones you win at carnivals, and I've seen people butcher songs on thousand dollar gear. Don't be like me - a new instrument will not make you sound better. You'll just make it sound worse.

So, where to start? 

I'm of the mind that the number one thing you want to do as a beginner guitarist is stretch your fingers, and that the best way to do that is to learn a lot of chords. Yep, I'm talking rhythm guitar. 

We'll get to melody, and improvisation in due course. For now, the move is to stretch those digits, learn a little, and make the whole rest of your journey easier and more comfortable. 

So, which chords? 

Technically, there are only 12 chords, with a few variations of each for some added flavour.
